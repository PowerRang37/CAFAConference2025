<p>Ben Shifrin is currently serving his 23rd year as head of Jemicy School in Owings Mills, Maryland, a college preparatory school that currently enrolls over 460 bright and talented students in grades 1-12 with dyslexia or other related language-based learning differences. 100% of the school’s graduates are accepted to colleges/universities and garner millions of dollars in merit-based scholarships yearly. Jemicy’s professional outreach programs aim to increase understanding of the science of reading and dyslexia and offer appropriate strategies to educators globally.</p>

    <p>Ben’s expertise and wealth of experience have guided Jemicy’s evolution, growth, and reach for the past two decades. Dyslexic himself, he brings a uniquely sensitive approach to working with students and lives up to his commitment that students’ needs come before all else. After moving to Baltimore in 2002 to lead what was then a 1st through 8th grade school with 143 students, Ben quickly facilitated a merger that successfully created the area’s first 1st through 12th grade school whose exclusive mission was to serve students with language-based learning differences. Under his leadership, Jemicy has distinguished itself internationally as one of the preeminent and most highly respected institutions in its field.</p>
    
    <p>Prior to coming to Jemicy, Ben lived and worked in California and spent 14 years serving as a special education administrator in the Unified School District of Los Angeles. He later served as the head of Westmark School, one of California’s premier institutions for students with learning differences.</p>
    
    <p>Ben is a member of the U.S. State Department’s Office of Overseas Schools’ Advisory Committee on Exceptional Children, the Dyslexia Foundation, and Stevenson University President’s Advisory Council. He also serves on the Board of Directors of the Dyslexia Tutoring Program. Previously, he was on the Executive Board of the International Dyslexia Association (IDA) and the Maryland Governor’s Dyslexia Task Force. Ben speaks nationally and internationally on the collaboration between neuroscience and education and on other topics relevant to learning differences.</p>
    
    <p>Ben attended Temple University, where he earned a B.S. in Elementary Education and a M.Ed. in Special Education and Administration, graduating summa cum laude with both degrees.</p>
